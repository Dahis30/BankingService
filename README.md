This small Spring Boot application represents a simple test for executing a banking service.

The main files are located at the following path : src/main/java/com/skypay/bankingservice

To test the execution of the program, there is a main method in : src/main/java/com/skypay/bankingservice/BankingApplication.java

Kind regards.
